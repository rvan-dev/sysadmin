# sysadmin
Just Scripts and Tools that can be pretty helpful  
Check the wiki for sometimes useful information  
This is very much wip and will be exteneded over time

  Take all the information with a grain of salt and don't take it as it, as it is mostly version dependent of the software (and I won't update until I need it again,so the information can be unreliable and outdatet but can still guide you onto the right path)
