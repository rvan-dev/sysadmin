# sysadmin
Just Scripts and Tools that can be pretty helpful  
Check the wiki for sometimes useful information  
This is very much wip and will be exteneded over time.  
Feel free to contribute with your scripts/knowledge or extend already existing stuff  
  
In every folder is an overview file which will give you an overview ;) of the scripts  

Take all the information with a grain of salt and don't take it as it, as it is mostly version dependent of the software (and I won't update until I need it again,so the information can be unreliable and outdated but can still guide you onto the right path)  
  
I don't take responsibility if any of my scripts or knowledge from the wiki break your system. Act with care and have backups/snapshots or other fallback options available before trying anything!  
If you don't understand what something does, don't just run it
